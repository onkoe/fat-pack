# Onkoe's Fat Pack
### for Minecraft 1.18.2
This is a pack designed to meet the needs of my friends at the Team GOAT Discord server! It isn't thoroughly tested, but I'm happy to accept and fix bug reports as it relates to the modpack. Please give your mod requests in my PMs or make a GitHub issue!

## Installation
Just import the ZIP file in Releases to your favorite Minecraft launcher! Personally, I suggest [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/download/), available [on Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.polymc.PolyMC). 

## Mod List
A comprehensive mod list [is available here](https://ecloud.global/s/Xb2nqDDTcLtGtEw)! Libraries are currently not included unless requested by authors/contributors.

## Development
Onkoe's Fat Pack uses [pax](https://github.com/froehlichA/pax) to dictate mod dependancies and conflicts. Install this for your platform, then follow the [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/froehlichA/pax/wiki/Quickstart)! On Fedora, pax may require the `openssl` and `openssl-devel` packages.

Bug reports, feature requests, and **security flaws** should be reported by GitHub issues. 

## Usage
This pack is licensed under the WTFPL. Please do whatever you'd like with it! :)

## Removals
I will happily comply with removal and credit requests! Please let me know via **GitHub issue**.
