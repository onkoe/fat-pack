# Wishlist
This represents a "wishlist" of future mods that would help the pack. Please check below before submitting a mod request. 

### [The Aether](https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether)
Port in progress. However, builds are currently unstable so they aren't used in this pack (yet). When stable releases appear on CF, please let us know via issues!

### [Construct's Armory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/constructs-armory)
No port as of yet. Stuck on 1.12 - direct port unlikely. 

### [Tinkers' Tool Leveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling)
This mod makes Tinkers' a lot less of a pain. However, the author [has no plans](https://twitter.com/bonusboni/status/1380212543269011459) to update past 1.12, let alone to 1.18.2. Please let us know if an alternative pops up!

### [Lovely Snails](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lovely-snails)
No Forge port (I understand it, devs).

### [Capybara](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/capybara-fabric)
Currently not ported to Forge. [UAM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unnamed-animal-mod-capybara-only) is also unported.

### [Nears](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nears)
Needs a 1.18.2 backport.

### [Probably Chests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/probably-chests)
Currently not ported to Forge.

### [Simple Void World](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-void-world)
Currently not ported to Forge.

### [Extra Generators](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-generators)
Currently not ported to Forge.
