# Won't Add

### [Lucky Blocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lucky-block/)
Replaced with [Chance Cubes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chance-cubes). Launcher download locked by author.

### [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home)
Optifine has a [restrictive license](https://optifine.net/copyright) that prevents modpacks from using it without permission. It will never be added unless it removes these conditions from its users. 

In the meantime (and probably forever), some ported Fabric alternatives are now being used. These offer something close to feature parity with Optifine, but without the closed licenses + source code. 

## Unavailable

### [The Aether](https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether)
Port in progress. However, builds are currently unstable so they aren't used in this pack (yet). When stable releases appear on CF, please let us know via issues!

### [Construct's Armory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/constructs-armory)
No port as of yet. Stuck on 1.12 - direct port unlikely. 

### [Tinkers' Tool Leveling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-tool-leveling)
This mod makes Tinkers' a lot less of a pain. However, the author [has no plans](https://twitter.com/bonusboni/status/1380212543269011459) to update past 1.12, let alone to 1.18.2. Please let us know if an alternative pops up!

### [Lovely Snails](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lovely-snails)
No Forge port (I understand it, devs).

### [Capybara](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/capybara-fabric)
Currently not ported to Forge. [UAM](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unnamed-animal-mod-capybara-only) is also unported.

### [Nears](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nears)
Needs a 1.18.2 backport.

### [Probably Chests](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/probably-chests)
Currently not ported to Forge.

### [Extra Generators](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extra-generators)
Currently not ported to Forge.

### [Fix Experience Bug](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fix-experience-bug)
